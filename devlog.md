Alright I've got like 3 hrs before I work out and then back on the road doing uber eats...

Despite having landed a good job I have still been f'ng around, I've been paying my bills/keeping up with the daily but I have not been paying down my debts.

Damn I'm not feeling it

One thing I want is this webworker thing that ticks in the background, I've set one up before so I'll just copy that
